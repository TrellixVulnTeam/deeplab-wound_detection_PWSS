1. Build the Dataset. We are going to generate a simple data set and then we will read it.
2. Build the DataLoader.
3. Build the model.
4. Define the loss function and the optimizer.
5. Train the model.
6. Generate predictions.
7. Plot the results. I hope it can be useful for someone who is starting programming using Pytorch.
